 : Bangladesh are the fifth team eliminated but they can go out with their heads held high. They have been entertaining from their first game as they overpowered a fancied South African team. Even when Australia and England plundered them for a lot of runs, they never dropped their guard. They missed a few key moments in their game against New Zealand and that I feel turned out to be really costly. They will be up against Pakistan next and would want to put up a good show as they bow out. India on the other hand have a death over concern for them with the bat and the ball. Today was the fourth game on the trot where India floundered in the last 15-20 overs with the bat and ended up with a score that looked a few runs light. And they played with a different combination today. Only five specialist bowlers and Pandya never looked like the weak link. Shami though at the death was again a little iffy. India has one more game against SL to iron out the flaws. It's never too late! And on that note, we will take a leave. This is <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> wishing you good night on behalf of <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy, Akshay Maanay, Abhinand Raghavendran, Nikhil Jadhav</b> and <b>Sulthan</b>.
